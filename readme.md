# Proposed zkPass Web Integration Schemas

Below are innovative schema ideas designed for securely proving and attesting private
information using zkPass. Each schema has been meticulously validated through the
zkPass schema validator and also testing the schema in a web app using the
zkPass-transgate sdk, ensuring full compliance and functionality with live data sources.
